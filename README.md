# TECHIN510_lab2
Create a web app that reads a dataset and displays interesting data visualizations about the dataset.
## getting started 


```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirement.txt

streamlit run app.py
```
##webapp features


- Use [text elements](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/text) (st.title, st.markdown, etc) to write a title and overview for your dataset (what is this dataset about? what each column means, etc).
- Use slider, dropdown, select widgets to filter data
- Use chart and maps to visualize data, if suitable for your dataset
- Use sidebar for filtering widgets
- Use columns or other layout elements to create more advanced layouts that increases UX and conveys the information more clearly



## lessons learned
I had a deeper understanding of git and how to use Streamlit to visualize data.
